  "rsid": "This section contains the Reference SNP ID (rsID), a unique and stable identifier assigned to a specific genetic variant. It helps users and researchers reference the variant unambiguously across studies and databases.",
  "organism": "This section specifies the species in which the variant is found, providing taxonomic context. For human variants, it will usually read 'Homo sapiens'.",
  "position": "This section gives the genomic location of the variant on a particular assembly or reference genome. It may include chromosome number, nucleotide position, and reference assembly name. Understanding this helps users locate the variant precisely on the genome.",
  "alleles": "This section lists the observed nucleotide changes at the variant site. For example, 'C>T' indicates that the reference allele is 'C' and the alternate allele is 'T'. It helps in identifying the specific mutation and its direction of change.",
  "variation_type": "This section describes the category of genetic variation, such as a single nucleotide variant (SNV), insertion, deletion, or complex variant. Knowing the type helps users understand the variant’s nature and potential impact.",
  "summary_frequency": "This section provides aggregated allele frequency information from various large-scale genomic databases (like TOPMed, ALFA, GnomAD). It shows how common each allele is in different populations, which aids in understanding the variant’s rarity or prevalence.",
  "clinical_significance_summary": "This section summarizes the medical or clinical importance of the variant, often referencing databases like ClinVar. It might include terms such as 'Pathogenic', 'Benign', 'Likely Pathogenic', or 'Uncertain Significance', giving a quick overview of its relevance to diseases.",
  "gene_consequence": "This section indicates which gene(s) are affected by the variant and describes the molecular consequence (e.g., missense, nonsense, synonymous change) on the gene’s coding sequence. It helps determine the potential functional impact of the variant at the protein level.",
  "publications_count": "This section gives a count of research articles associated with the variant. It helps users gauge the level of scientific interest and how well-studied the variant is.",
  "dbsnp_frequency_table": "This section displays a tabular summary of allele frequencies from various studies and populations curated by dbSNP. It includes sample sizes, reference and alternate allele frequencies, and population groups, helping users understand population genetics aspects of the variant.",
  "alfa_popfreq_table": "This section provides allele frequency data from the Allele Frequency Aggregator (ALFA). It includes detailed breakdowns by population groups and provides homozygote/heterozygote counts to help researchers and clinicians assess the population-level impact of the variant.",
  "variant_details": "This section offers specific information regarding the variant’s genomic placements across different reference assemblies or transcripts. It supports cross-referencing and verifying how the variant is mapped onto different genomic coordinates.",
  "clinical_significance": "This section provides detailed listings of clinical interpretations from various sources or submissions, showing how different laboratories or databases classify the variant’s relevance to diseases or phenotypes. It aids in clinical decision-making and genetic counseling.",
  "hgvs": "This section presents the variant’s standardized nomenclature according to the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) guidelines. It shows transcript and protein-level notations (e.g., NM_..., NP_...), enabling precise communication of variant location and effect.",
  "submissions": "This section lists the individual data submissions that contributed to the variant’s record. It includes submitter names, submission IDs, and the database build at the time of submission. This provides traceability and provenance of the variant’s data.",
  "history": "This section documents the variant’s historical record, including previous IDs, remapped coordinates, and changes in interpretation. It allows users to track how knowledge about the variant has evolved over time.",
  "publications": "This section references scientific literature (with PubMed IDs, authors, titles, and journal details) related to the variant. Researchers can use it to find studies that have characterized the variant’s effect, studied its association with diseases, or explored its functional consequences."
